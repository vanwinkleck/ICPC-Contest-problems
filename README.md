# ICPC-Contest-problems
An assortment of problems worked on by myself and Mikayel Darbinyan and made by Dr. Jason Fritts for a class I took spring semester 2019

Attached is the assignment guide originally given to us by Dr. Fritts, which contains explanations for all 5 problems. 

Problem 1: Gnome sequencing
In the book All Creatures of Mythology, gnomes are kind, bearded creatures, while goblins tend to be bossy and simple-minded. The goblins like to harass the gnomes by making them line up in groups, ordered by the length of their beards. The gnomes, being of different physical heights, vary the size of the groups and their arrangements to confuse the goblins. Therefore, the goblins must actually measure the beards in centimetersto see if everyone is lined up in order.
Your task is to write a program to assist the goblins in determining whether or not the gnomes are lined up properly from shortest beard length to longest.
Input:The beard lengths of a group of gnomes all appear in a single line separated by spaces.
Output:Should be “Ordered” if they are standing in order of increasing beard length and “Unordered” otherwise. 
There should be no other output.
